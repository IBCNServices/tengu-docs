Congrats! You just received your own **Hauchiwa**! This is a Linux machine that gives you easy access the Tengu and Juju management tools and the `tengu-charms` repository.

# Tengu management tools

The Tengu management tools allow you to create and destroy Tengu environments. For more information on this go to the [Tengu management README.md](https://github.com/galgalesh/tengu-charms/blob/master/charms/layers/hauchiwa/files/tengu_management/README.md). You can find more information about Tengu in [the Tengu README.md](https://github.com/galgalesh/tengu-charms/blob/master/README.md)

# Tengu environment

A Tengu environment is a Juju environment on steroids. You get 

 - a bunch of container-ready machines;
 - a private internal network with a gateway and a VPN;
 - and a juju-gui.

Check the status of your Tengu environment with

    watch juju status --format tabular

This is what a default Tengu environment looks like:

```

```

It's best to not mess with these services since they make sure your machines are container-ready. Let's add some services shall we? Tengu is perfect to deploy distributed data tools such as Hadoop and Spark. Let's deploy a Hadoop cluster.

    juju deploy apache-hadoop-hdfs-master hdfs-master --to lxc:0
    juju deploy apache-hadoop-yarn-master yarn-master --to lxc:0
    juju deploy apache-hadoop-compute-slave compute-slave --to lxc:1
    juju add-relation yarn-master hdfs-master
    juju add-relation compute-slave yarn-master
    juju add-relation compute-slave hdfs-master

The `--to lxc:1` tells Juju to deploy the service to an `lxc` container on host `1`. These containers isolate each service from one another and allow you to dynamically deploy and destroy services without needing to reload the physical machines. Juju has a lot more [bigdata Charms](http://bigdata.juju.solutions/getstarted). Go to the [Charm store](https://jujucharms.com/) to get even more awesomeness!

Tengu also has a bunch of Tengu-specific Charms that are not in the Charm store. These Charms are located in `/opt/tengu-charms/charms`. You can deploy charms from this local repository using `juju deploy *local:*wso2-esb --to lxc:0`.


## Juju tools

Juju is Tengu's backend. You can deploy and manage services using Juju. Some useful commands:

- `watch juju status --format tabular` shows you a real-time view of the currently deployed environment. press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>c</kbd> to exit.
- [`juju dhx`](https://jujucharms.com/docs/1.24/authors-hook-debug-dhx#running-dhx) allows you to debug a unit that is in an `error` state.
- destroy-machine --force
- `juju add-unit <service name> -n <# of units> --to <comma separated list of containers:hosts where the units will be deployed, e.g. lxc:1,lxc:2>` allows you to scale a service
