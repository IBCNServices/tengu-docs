# FAQ

#### ERROR cannot assign unit ... to machine: **Help!**

    ERROR cannot assign unit ... to machine: cannot assign unit ... to new machine or container: cannot assign unit ... to new machine: use "juju add-machine ssh:[user@]<host>" to provision machines```

This error tells you that Juju cannot find any more empty machines to deploy the units of a Charm to. Juju created the Charm, but cannot deploy it to any machines because no machine is empty. Tell Juju to deploy a unit into a container using `juju add-unit <service-name> --to lxc:<machine-number>`. For new charms use `juju deploy <charm-name> --to lxc:1`.

#### I tried to destroy a service but it stays in error state?

Juju is event-based. Events get pushed to the state server and Juju agents poll these events and execute them one by one. When an event fails, the Juju agents goes into error state and pauzes all execution until an administrator marks the error as resolved using `juju resolve <charmname/unit#>`. "Destroy the service" is also an event, so a service that is in an error state will not be destroyed until the error is resolved. You can fix this by either running

    juju resolved <charmname/unit#>

or force-destroying the machine the unit is on by running

    juju destroy-machine <host#>/lxc/<container#>

DO NOT DESTROY THE HOST MACHINES THEMSELVES! Only destroy containers.

#### All commands give "unable to connect" errors

If you are getting the following errors then your Hauchiwa can't connect to the Juju state server.

```
WARNING discarding API open error: unable to connect to "wss://192.168.14.1:17070/environment/68e9d160-5b52-405d-8a4c-b9860f5ddedd/api"
ERROR unable to connect to "wss://n061-11b.wall2.ilabt.iminds.be:17070/environment/68e9d160-5b52-405d-8a4c-b9860f5ddedd/api"
```

Either the state server has crashed or the jFed experiment is gone. Check the jFed experiment status by running `tengu status` (it can take a while to get a response). If the state is `READY` then the jFed experiment is still running.

If the jFed experiment still exists then the cause is probably that **the disk of machine `0` is full.** You need to remove files from machine `0` and restart the Juju services on that machine.

1. **ssh to machine `0`**: Run `ssh ubuntu@<IP>`. You can get the ip from the environment config (`nano ~/.juju/environments/$(juju switch).jenv`). Run `df -h` to see how much space is left. Always keep `~10G` free space.
2. **Remove files**: Log in as root `sudo su -` and check where your disk space went: `du -h /var | grep '[0-9\.]\+G`.
3. **Restart Juju services**: Log in as root `sudo su -` and see what services are present: `initctl list | grep juju`. Restart *all* Juju services by running `restart <service-name>`.

#### I get the "agent is lost" messages

This message means that Juju cannot connect to the Juju agents on those machines. Either reboot the machines/containers themselves, or restart the jujud manually:

- ssh to the unit (container or physical machine) that is lost
- run `sudo su -`
- run `initctl list | grep jujud` and you'll see al the jujud services
- restart the one that is lost for example `restart jujud-unit-ganglia-node-4`
